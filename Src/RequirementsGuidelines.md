This document provides a set of guidelines for writing good requirements, sourced from the INCOSE Guide for Writing Good Requirements (GfWR).

# General Rules for Requirement Statements
| Rule | Title                     | Description |
|------|---------------------------|-------------|
| R2   | Active Voice              | Use the active voice in the need or requirement statement with the responsible entity clearly identified as the subject of the sentence. |
| R3   | Appropriate Subject-Verb  | Ensure the subject and verb of the need or requirement statement are appropriate to the entity to which the statement refers. |
| R4   | Defined Terms             | Define all terms used within the need statement and requirement statement within an associated glossary and/or data dictionary. |
| R6   | Common Units of Measure   | When stating quantities, all numbers should have appropriate and consistent units of measure explicitly stated using a common measurement system in terms of the thing the number refers. |
| R18  | Single Thought Sentence   | Write a single sentence that contains a single thought conditioned and qualified by relevant sub-clauses. |
| R19  | Combinators               | Avoid words that join or combine clauses, such as “and”, “or”, “then”, “unless”, “but”, “as well as”, “but also”, “however”, “whether”, “meanwhile”, “whereas”, “on the other hand”, or “otherwise”. |
| R12   | Correct Grammar         | Use correct grammar, spelling, and punctuation. |
| R13   | Correct Spelling        | Ensure correct spelling is used. |
| R14   | Correct Punctuation     | Use correct punctuation. |
| R16   | Use of “Not”            | Avoid the use of “not.” |
| R24   | Pronouns                | Avoid the use of personal and indefinite pronouns. |
| R25   | Headings                | Avoid relying on headings to support explanation or understanding of the need or requirement. |
| R33   | Range of Values         | Define each quantity with a range of values appropriate to the entity to which the quantity applies and against which the entity will be verified or validated. |
| R34   | Measurable Performance  | Provide specific measurable performance targets appropriate to the entity to which the need or requirement is stated and against which the entity will be verified to meet. |


# Characteristics of good requirements statements:
| Criteria      | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| Necessary    | The requirement defines an essential capability, characteristic, constraint, and/or quality factor. |
| Appropriate  | The specific intent and amount of detail of the requirement is appropriate for the level entity to which it refers (level of abstraction). |
| Unambiguous  | The requirement is stated in such a way that it can be interpreted in only one way. |
| Complete     | The requirement sufficiently describes the necessary capability, characteristic, constraint, or quality factor to meet the entity need without needing other information to understand the requirement. |
| Singular     | The requirement should state a single capability, characteristic, constraint, or quality factor. |
| Verifiable   | The requirement is structured and worded such that its realization can be proven (verified) to the customer’s satisfaction at the level the requirements exist. |
| Conforming   | The individual requirements should conform to an approved standard template and style for writing requirements, when applicable. |
| Correct      | The requirement must be an accurate representation of the entity need from which it was transformed. |
| Feasible     | The requirement can be realized within entity constraints (e.g., cost, schedule, technical, legal, regulatory) with acceptable risk. |


# Characteristics of set of requirements statements:
| Criteria           | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| Complete         | The requirement set stands alone such that it sufficiently describes the necessary capabilities, characteristics, constraints, and/or quality factors to meet the entity needs without needing other information. |
| Consistent       | The set of requirements contains individual requirements that are unique, do not conflict with or overlap with other requirements in the set, and the units and measurement systems they use are homogeneous. The language used within the set of requirements is consistent, i.e., the same word is used throughout the set to mean the same thing. |
| Feasible         | The requirement set can be realized within entity constraints (e.g., cost, schedule, technical, legal, regulatory) with acceptable risk. |
| Comprehensible   | The set of requirements must be written such that it is clear as to what is expected by the entity and its relation to the system of which it is a part. |
| Able to be validated | It must be able to be proven that the requirement set will lead to the achievement of the entity needs within the constraints (such as cost, schedule, technical, legal, and regulatory compliance). |


# Rules for Avoiding Ambiguity
| Rule  | Title                | Description |
|-------|----------------------|-------------|
| R7    | Vague Terms         | Avoid the use of vague terms that provide vague quantification, such as “some”, “any”, “allowable”, “several”, “many”, “a lot of”, “a few”, “almost always”, “very nearly”, “nearly”, “about”, “close to”, “almost”, and “approximate”. Avoid vague adjectives such as “ancillary”, "relevant”, “routine”, “common”, “generic”, “significant”, “flexible”, “expandable”, “typical”, “sufficient”, “adequate”, “appropriate”, “efficient”, “effective”, “proficient”, “reasonable” and “customary.” |
| R8    | Escape Clauses      | Avoid the inclusion of escape clauses that state vague conditions or possibilities, such as “so far as is possible”, “as little as possible”, “where possible”, “as much as possible”, “if it should prove necessary”, “if necessary”, “to the extent necessary”, “as appropriate”, “as required”, “to the extent practical”, and “if practicable”. |
| R9    | Open-Ended Clauses  | Avoid open-ended, non-specific clauses such as “including but not limited to”, “etc.” and “and so on.” |


# Rules for Writing Good Requirements
| Rule  | Title                    | Description |
|-------|--------------------------|-------------|
| R10   | Superfluous Infinitives  | Avoid the use of superfluous infinitives such as “to be designed to”, “to be able to”, “to be capable of”, “to enable”, “to allow”. |
| R17   | Use of Oblique Symbol    | Avoid the use of the oblique ("/") symbol except in units, i.e., Km/hr, or fractions. |
| R20   | Purpose Phrases         | Avoid phrases that indicate the “purpose of“, “intent of”, or “reason for” the need statement or requirement statement. |
| R26   | Absolutes               | Avoid using unachievable absolutes such as 100% reliability, 100% availability, all, every, always, never, etc. |
| R32   | Universal Qualification | Use “each” instead of “all”, “any”, or “both” when universal quantification is intended. |
| R35   | Temporal Dependencies   | Define temporal dependencies explicitly instead of using indefinite temporal keywords such as “eventually”, “until”, “before”, “after”, “as”, “once”, “earliest”, “latest”, “instantaneous”, “simultaneous”, and “at last”. |


# Rules for writing well-formed requirement statements
| Rule  | Title                              | Description |
|-------|------------------------------------|-------------|
| R5    | Definite Articles                 | Use the definite article “the” rather than the indefinite articles “a” or “an”. |
| R15   | Logical Expressions               | Use a defined convention to express logical expressions such as “[X AND Y]”, “[X OR Y]”, “[X XOR Y]”, “NOT [X OR Y]”. |
| R21   | Parentheses                       | Avoid parentheses and brackets containing subordinate text. |
| R22   | Enumeration                       | Enumerate sets explicitly instead of using a group noun to name the set. |
| R23   | Supporting Diagram, Model, or ICD | When a need or requirement is related to complex behavior, refer to a supporting diagram, model, or ICD. |
| R29   | Classification                    | Classify needs and requirements according to the aspects of the problem or system it addresses. |
| R30   | Unique Expression                 | Express each need and requirement once and only once. |
| R31   | Solution Free                     | Avoid stating implementation in a need statement or requirement statement unless there is rationale for constraining the design. |
